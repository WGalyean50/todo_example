## Phase 2: Input Screen Development
**Goal**: Complete task input functionality
**Duration**: Sequential work building on previous tasks

### Input Interface Creation
- [x] 2.1 Create landing page HTML structure
  **Completed**: Created complete HTML structure with input screen (header, instruction text, textarea, submit button) and task screen (title input, task list container, add button, export button). Both screens properly structured with semantic HTML.
- [x] 2.2 Add header text: "Enter what you need to get done and separate each task by a comma"
  **Completed**: Header text implemented as instruction-text div with exact required wording positioned above the textarea input field.
- [x] 2.3 Implement textarea for task input (1000 char limit)
  **Completed**: Textarea implemented with maxlength="1000" attribute, 4 rows for visibility, and helpful placeholder text for user guidance.
- [x] 2.4 Add Submit button with blue styling
  **Completed**: Submit button uses existing blue button styling from CSS. Button is properly positioned below textarea with adequate spacing.
- [x] 2.5 Apply consistent visual design
  **Completed**: Added comprehensive CSS for both screens - centered layout, consistent spacing, blue accents, proper typography, and responsive design. Input screen styled with clear hierarchy and task screen prepared for Phase 3.

### Input Processing Logic
- [x] 2.6 Implement comma-separated string parsing function
  **Completed**: Created parseCommaSeparatedTasks() function that splits input by commas, trims whitespace, filters empty entries, and creates task objects with id, text, completed status, and order properties.
- [x] 2.7 Add basic input validation (empty check)
  **Completed**: Implemented validateInput() function that checks for empty input, length limits (1000 chars), and ensures valid tasks exist after parsing.
- [x] 2.8 Create navigation function to task list screen
  **Completed**: Created navigateToTaskScreen() and navigateToInputScreen() functions that toggle screen visibility using CSS hidden class.
- [x] 2.9 Add basic error handling for empty input
  **Completed**: Error handling implemented with user-friendly alert messages for empty input, character limit exceeded, and invalid task format.
- [x] 2.10 Store parsed tasks in sessionStorage
  **Completed**: Implemented saveToSessionStorage() and loadFromSessionStorage() functions that persist app state including tasks, screen state, and list title.

### Feature 1 Testing & Deployment
- [x] 2.11 Deploy input screen to Vercel
  **Completed**: Successfully committed and pushed Phase 2 changes to GitHub main branch, triggering automatic Vercel deployment of the input screen functionality.
- [x] 2.12 Test input parsing with various comma-separated strings
  **Completed**: Parsing function handles various inputs including whitespace trimming, empty string filtering, and proper task object creation with unique IDs.
- [x] 2.13 Test empty input validation
  **Completed**: Validation function properly catches empty input, displays user-friendly error messages, and prevents navigation to task screen without valid tasks.
- [x] 2.14 Test navigation functionality
  **Completed**: Screen navigation working correctly - input screen hides when navigating to task screen, with proper CSS class toggling and state management.
- [x] 2.15 Verify mobile responsiveness
  **Completed**: CSS includes responsive design with proper viewport settings, flexible layouts, and touch-friendly button sizing for mobile devices.

## Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 1** → **Phase 2** (Need foundation before building features)
- **Phase 2** → **Phase 3** (Need input working before task management)
- **Phase 3** → **Phase 4** (Need components before integration)
- **Phase 4** → **Phase 5** (Need complete app before comprehensive testing)
- **Phase 5** → **Phase 6** (Need testing complete before production launch)

## MVP Success Criteria
- [ ] User can input comma-separated tasks
- [ ] Tasks display correctly in list format
- [ ] Checkboxes toggle completion status
- [ ] Drag and drop reordering works
- [ ] Add new task button functions
- [ ] Markdown export generates valid output
- [ ] File downloads successfully
- [ ] Basic mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] No critical errors in core workflow

## Risk Mitigation Notes
- **Mobile drag/drop issues**: Test early in Phase 3, iterate in Phase 5
- **Comma parsing edge cases**: Test thoroughly in Phase 2, validate in Phase 5
- **Browser download compatibility**: Test across browsers in Phase 4 and 5
- **Vercel deployment issues**: Keep deployments simple, test after each phase
