- **Phase 2** → **Phase 3** (Need input working before task management)
- **Phase 3** → **Phase 4** (Need components before integration)
- **Phase 4** → **Phase 5** (Need complete app before comprehensive testing)
- **Phase 5** → **Phase 6** (Need testing complete before production launch)

## MVP Success Criteria
- [ ] User can input comma-separated tasks
- [ ] Tasks display correctly in list format
- [ ] Checkboxes toggle completion status
- [ ] Drag and drop reordering works
- [ ] Add new task button functions
- [ ] Markdown export generates valid output
- [ ] File downloads successfully
