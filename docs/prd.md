# Product Requirements Document: Test To Do App MVP

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name**: Test To Do App MVP
**Version**: 0.1 (MVP)
**Date**: September 24, 2025
**Document Status**: Draft

Test To Do App MVP is a minimal viable product - a simple, web-based task management application that demonstrates core functionality for quickly inputting multiple tasks via comma-separated text, organizing them in a basic interface, and exporting completed lists as markdown files.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Users need a quick, frictionless way to capture multiple tasks at once and organize them into actionable to-do lists without the complexity of traditional task management applications.

### 2.2 Solution
A basic two-screen web application MVP that demonstrates the core concept: streamlined task entry through comma-separated input with minimal task management features including basic reordering, completion tracking, and markdown export.

### 2.3 Target Users (MVP Scope)
- Early adopters willing to test basic functionality
- Developers and stakeholders evaluating the concept
- Users needing simple proof-of-concept task management

## 3. Product Goals & Success Metrics

### 3.1 MVP Goals
- Demonstrate core concept functionality
- Validate user workflow from input to export
- Prove technical feasibility of comma-separated parsing

### 3.2 MVP Success Metrics
- Basic functionality works without critical errors
- User can complete full flow (input → organize → export)
- Comma-separated parsing works for simple cases
- Markdown export generates valid output

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Features

#### Feature 1: Task Input Screen (MVP)
**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)
- **Input Field**: Basic text box accepting comma-separated tasks
- **Instructions**: Simple header text: "Enter what you need to get done and separate each task by a comma"
- **Submit Button**: Basic button that transitions to task management screen
- **Validation**: Simple comma-separated parsing (basic implementation)

**MVP Acceptance Criteria**:
- Text input works for reasonable character lengths (up to 1000 chars)
- Basic comma parsing creates individual task items
- Submit button navigates to task list screen
- Minimal error handling for empty input

#### Feature 2: Task Management Screen (MVP)
**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)
- **List Title**: Basic editable field for naming the to-do list
- **Task Display**: Simple vertical list showing all parsed tasks
- **Completion Tracking**: Basic checkbox for each task
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Simple drag and drop (using basic library)
- **Add Task Button**: Basic plus (+) button at top, adds new task to beginning of list

**MVP Acceptance Criteria**:
- All initially entered tasks appear in list
- Title field allows basic text input
- Checkboxes toggle completion status (visual only)
- Basic drag and drop reorders tasks (may have minor UX issues)
- Plus button creates new task at top (basic implementation)
- Minimal visual feedback during interactions

#### Feature 3: Export Functionality (MVP)
**Priority**: P0 (Must Have)
- **Export Button**: Basic "Export as markdown" button at bottom
- **Markdown Generation**: Simple conversion to basic markdown format
- **File Download**: Basic file download to user's machine

**MVP Acceptance Criteria**:
- Export button generates basic markdown format
- Completed tasks show as `[x]`, incomplete as `[ ]`
- List title becomes markdown header (if title exists)
- File downloads with basic filename (e.g., "todo-list.md")
- Task order preserved in export (basic implementation)

### 4.2 User Interface Requirements

#### 4.2.1 Visual Design
- **Background**: White
- **Typography**: Sans serif fonts throughout
- **Button Color**: Blue for all interactive buttons
- **Layout**: Clean, minimal, centered design

#### 4.2.2 Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Tablet compatibility
- Desktop optimization
- Touch-friendly interactions

### 4.3 Technical Requirements

#### 4.3.1 MVP Frontend
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (simplest approach)
- **State Management**: Basic DOM manipulation and local variables
- **Drag & Drop**: Simple drag and drop library (Sortable.js)
- **File Generation**: Basic client-side markdown generation and download

#### 4.3.2 MVP Backend Architecture

**MVP Approach: Client-Side Only**
- No backend required for MVP
- Browser sessionStorage for temporary persistence
- JavaScript-based data processing
- Client-side export generation
- Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify)

**Future: Hybrid Approach (Post-MVP)**
- Could add simple API endpoints later if needed

#### 4.3.3 Data Models
```javascript
Task {
  id: string (UUID)
  text: string
  completed: boolean
  order: number
}

TodoList {
  id: string (UUID)
  title: string
  tasks: Task[]
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

## 5. User Experience Flow

### 5.1 Happy Path User Journey
1. **Landing**: User opens app, sees task input screen
2. **Input**: User enters comma-separated tasks
3. **Parse**: System validates and parses input
4. **Submit**: User clicks submit, navigates to task list
5. **Organize**: User adds title, reorders tasks, marks complete
6. **Export**: User exports as markdown file
7. **Download**: File downloads to local machine

### 5.2 Error Handling
- Empty input validation with clear error messages
- Malformed comma parsing with suggestion to retry
- Export failure fallback with retry option

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 MVP Performance
- Page load time < 5 seconds (acceptable for MVP)
- Task operations work without major delays
- Export generation works for lists up to 50 tasks

### 6.2 MVP Security
- Basic input sanitization (escape HTML characters)
- Client-side validation for critical inputs
- Basic markdown generation (minimal security concerns for MVP)

### 6.3 MVP Browser Compatibility
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Limited mobile testing

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Scalability
- Design for lists up to 100 tasks
- Efficient drag and drop algorithms
- Lazy loading for future expansion

### 7.2 Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- High contrast mode support

## 8. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope v1.0)

### 8.1 Priority 2 Features
- Task due dates
- Task categories/tags
- Multiple list management
- Cloud synchronization

### 8.2 Integration Possibilities
- Calendar integration
- Email sharing
- Third-party app exports (Todoist, Asana)
