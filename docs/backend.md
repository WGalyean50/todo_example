# Backend Analysis: Test To Do App MVP

## Overview
Based on the transcript analysis, the Test To Do App MVP requires minimal backend complexity, focusing on client-side functionality to demonstrate core concepts quickly.

## MVP Backend Requirements (Client-Side Focus)

### 1. Data Processing & Validation (Minimal)
- **Input Parsing**: Basic comma-separated string parsing with JavaScript
- **Data Sanitization**: Simple HTML escaping to prevent basic XSS
- **Task Structure**: Simple JavaScript objects with properties:
  - `id`: Simple timestamp or counter
  - `text`: Task description (basic string)
  - `completed`: Boolean status
  - `order`: Array index for ordering

### 2. MVP Data Management (Client-Side)
- **Task Operations** (JavaScript only):
  - Create new tasks from input and plus button
  - Toggle task completion status
  - Basic reordering via array manipulation
  - No delete functionality in MVP
- **List Management** (Browser Storage):
  - Store list title in memory/sessionStorage
  - Maintain task array in JavaScript
  - Temporary persistence only (session-based)

### 3. MVP Export System (Client-Side)
- **Markdown Generation**: Simple client-side conversion
  - Basic markdown checkbox syntax (`- [ ] Task` / `- [x] Task`)
  - Include list title as H1 header if present
  - Simple task order preservation
- **File Generation**: Browser download API to create .md file

### 4. MVP API Endpoints
**None required for MVP** - Pure client-side implementation

### 5. MVP Data Storage
- **Session Storage**: Primary storage for current session
- **No Database**: Eliminates complexity for MVP
- **No Persistent Storage**: Data lost on page refresh (acceptable for MVP)
- **Simple Data Structure**:
```javascript
// In-memory JavaScript objects
const todoList = {
  title: "",
  tasks: [{ id: 1, text: "Task", completed: false }]
}
```

### 6. MVP Technical Architecture

#### MVP Choice: Client-Side Only
- Use browser sessionStorage for temporary persistence
- Vanilla JavaScript handles all data processing
- Export functionality via browser download APIs
- No server required - can be hosted on GitHub Pages
- Static HTML/CSS/JS files only

#### Post-MVP: Could Add Server
- Simple Node.js backend for persistence
- Basic API endpoints for data storage
- Database integration for multi-session use

### 7. MVP Security Considerations
- Basic input sanitization (escape HTML)
- No server-side vulnerabilities (client-side only)
- Simple XSS prevention in markdown export
- Minimal attack surface

### 8. MVP Performance Considerations
- Simple task operations (no optimization needed)
- Basic drag and drop performance
- Small task lists only (< 50 tasks)
- Simple markdown export (no compression)

## MVP Implementation Recommendation
For the MVP, a **pure client-side approach** is ideal:
- No server setup required
- Fast development and deployment
- Easy testing and iteration
- Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify)
- Focus on proving core concept
